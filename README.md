# SharePosts

A project where a user can sign-up and share a post as much as he like! This project was made by following the OOP-PHP-MVC tutorial by Brad Traversy.

# What I Learned
* Object Oriented Programming in PHP.
* Build the framework - MVC Workflow.
* Added user authentication.
* CRUD functionalities of posts.
* Deployed app to web hosting.

# Usage
Make sure to add database (shareposts.sql) to localhost/phpmyadmin. 
If you have xampp installed or something similar, clone the project under htdocs.
Visit localhost/shareposts.
